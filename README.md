# Linux-alarm
This is a guide to building a basic alarm clock using C in Linux.
It takes and prints the current time of the system and asks the user for the alarm time.
The code then compares the current time to the set time.
I could not find anything good enough for a ringtone and hence used the small beep sound in a loop.
